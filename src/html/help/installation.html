<h3><a name="Installers"></a>Installing DataWarrior</h3>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installers are available for Linux, Macintosh and Windows.
DataWarrior was written in Java and its complete source code is published under the
<span class="keyword">GNU Public License</span>. Installers for the three platforms, and the source code
can be downloaded from www.openmolecules.org. The DataWarrior installation contains various example
files and a complete user manual, which is accessible from within the application. In addition to
the embedded documentation the user manual is also accessible online at www.openmolecules.org.</p>

<p>To install <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> on <span class="keyword">Windows</span> you need
a working Java Runtime environment to be installed. If this is not the case, please download and install
Java from the java.com website. Depending on the Java architecture (32- or 64-bit) you need to download
the matching <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installer. The <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
downlod page explains, how you can check, which Java architecture you have installed.
To install <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> itself just double click the downloaded datawarrior.msi
file and follow the instructions. Anytime later you may traceless uninstall the program using the
<span class="keyword">Control Panel</span>.
</p>
<p>To install <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> on the <span class="keyword">Macintosh</span>
just double click the downloaded datawarrior.dmg file and drag the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
application icon onto the Application folder. In the unlikely case you want to de-install the software later,
just drag the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> folder from the application folder into the trash. 
</p>
<p>To install <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> on <span class="keyword">Linux</span> unpack the
downloaded datawarrior.tar.gz file to any location and run the install script with root privileges.
To later uninstall <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> you may run /opt/uninstall with root privileges.
</p>

<h3>Updating DataWarrior</h3>
<p>In order to update an existing <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installation to a newer version,
we recommend to uninstall the previous version as described above and then to install the new version.
If you have saved or modified any files in the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installation directory
or any of its subfolders (e.g. 'reference', 'example', or the 'macro' folder), then you should copy these files
to a safe place before uninstalling the outdated <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> version.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="LookAndFeel"></a>Look & Feel</h3>
<p>When <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> launches for the first time, it uses the <span class="keyword">Graphite
Look & Feel</span>, which means that all user interface elements and the background are drawn in a dark grayish tone.
This emphasises in particular color-rich views. Since aesthetic perception depends on the individuum,
the <span class="menu">Help</span> menu allows to choose from a couple of different <span class="keyword">Look & Feels</span>.
The chosen <span class="keyword">Look & Feels</span> is stored as part of <span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span>
settings.</p>

<h3><a name="HiDPI"></a>Hi-Resolution Monitors</h3>
<p>During recent years computer and monitor manufacturers have introduced monitors with substantially
higher resolutions than what was common before. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> supports
these monitors on all three platforms, but in a slightly different way, because high resolution
monitors are handled differently on different operating systems. In general user interface elements
as buttons, combo boxes and menu items are enlarged to make up for the smaller pixel size. Therefore,
everything looks much sharper.</p>
<p>On <span class="keyword">Windows</span> the enlargement factor can be defined for all applications
in the in the <span class="keyword">Display Control Panel</span> under <span class="keyword">Appearance
and Personalization</span>. Under some versions of Windows it is also necessary to disable DPI virtualization
for the DataWarrior application. To do so, right-click the name of the DataWarrior executable file,
click Properties, click the Compatibility tab, and then select the box labeled <span class="keyword">Disable
display scaling on high DPI settings</span>.</p>
<p>On Retina displays of the <span class="keyword">Macintosh</span> this factor is predefined as 2.0.
And on <span class="keyword">Linux</span> it depends on the Linux dialect. Usually the scaling factor
can be defined in the display settings dialog. On Ubuntu the relevant slider is called <span class="keyword">
Scale for menu and title bars</span>, which is recognized by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>.
For Linux dialects without that setting, or if DataWarrior does not automatically recognize the setting,
one may add an 'dpifactor' parameter to the script that launches DataWarrior ('/opt/datawarrior/datawarrior').
For instance to increase all user interface elements by 50% insert a dpifactor of 1.5 into the second line
after the -X options. It looks then like:<br>
java -Xms1000m -Xmx4000m -Ddpifactor=1.5 -Ddatapath=...
