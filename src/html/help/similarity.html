<h2><a name="MoleculeSimilarity"></a>Molecule Similarity and Descriptors</h2>

<hr align="left" size="2" width="550">
<p>Similarities values between molecules play an important role in <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>.
They are used to filter compounds or to customize views, e.g. to color and position markers based on compound similarities.
Some alpha-numerical data analysis features also work based on compound similarities, e.g. self organizing maps.
In addition many dedicated cheminformatics analysis methods require a similarity criterion
for molecules, e.g. activity cliff analysis, compound clustering, and more. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
supports various kinds of molecule similarities. These range from a simple chemical similarity based on shared substructure
fragments up to a biological similarity that considers 3D-geometry and binding behavior.</p>
<p>When <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> calculates a similarity value between two molecules,
then the calculation is not performed on the molecular graphs directly. It rather involves a two step process:
<li>The molecular graph of every molecule is processed to extract certain molecule features.
These are compiled into an abstract molecule description, called <span class="keyword">descriptor</span>.
In the simplest case the descriptor consists of a binary array of which every bit indicates, whether a certain
feature is present in the molecule. Binary <span class="keyword">descriptors</span> are also referred to as
<span class="keyword">fingerprints</span>.</li>
<li>In a second step the <span class="keyword">descriptors</span> of two molecules are compared to reveal the similarity value,
i.e. how much the two compounds have in common. In case of a binary descriptor one usually devides the
number of common features by the number of features being available in both two molecules. This is referred to
as <span class="keyword">Tanimoto</span> similarity.</li>
</p>
<p>Naturally, the kind of features being collected has a substantial influence on the kind of similarity calculated.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> supports three different binary descriptors and three more
advanced similarity methods, which are all explained in more detail.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="WhichDescriptor"></a>Which Descriptor Should Be Used For Which Purpose</h3>
<p>If the purpose is to filter a large compound collection by chemical structure similarity, the default
<span class="keyword">descriptor FragFp</span> is a good choice, because it is automatically available,
it does not require much space and similarity calculations are practically instantanious.</p>
<p>If more fine grained similaries need to be perceived, e.g. if stereo isomers need to be distinguished
or to achieve best results from clustering or any kind of similarity analysis, then the
<span class="keyword">SkelSpheres descriptor</span> should be taken. Especially, when creating an evolutionary library
in vast virtual compound space, then the <span class="keyword">SkelSpheres descriptor</span> outperformes
the binary fingerprints in quality, because it considers multiple fragment occurence and makes hash collisions unlikely.</p>
<p>When chemical functionality from a synthetic chemist's point of view is more important than the carbon skeleton
that carries this functionality, the you should try the <span class="keyword">OrgFunctions descriptor</span>.
Examples are searching a chemicals database for an alternative reactant to a reaction or arranging a building
blocks collection in space based synthetically accessible functionality.</p>
<p>If the similarity of biological binding behaviour is key rather than merely the similarity of the chemical graph,
then use the <span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptor</span>, which requires more space and significantly more
time to calculate descriptors as well as similarity values.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="FragFp"></a>The <span class="keyword">FragFp</span> Descriptor</h3>
DataWarrior's default descriptor <span class="keyword">FragFp</span> is a substructure fragment dictionary
based binary fingerprint similar to the MDL keys. It relies on a dictionary of 512 predefined structure fragments.
These were selected from the multitude of possible structure fragments by optimizing two criteria:
All chosen fragments should occurr frequently withing typical organic molecule structures.
Any two chosen fragments should show little overlap concerning their occurrence in diverse sets of organic compounds.
The <span class="keyword">FragFp descriptor</span> contains 1 bit for every fragment in the dictionary. A bit set to 1 if
the corresponding fragment is present in the molecule at least on time. In about half of the fragments
all hetero atoms have been replaced by wild cards. This way single atom replacements only cause a moderate drop of
similarity, which reflects a chemists natural similarity perception.</p>
<p>In addition to calculating molecule similarities <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses the
<span class="keyword">FragFp descriptor</span> for a second purpose: The acceleration of the sub-structure filtering.
Since a sub-structure search is effectively a graph matching algorithm and therefore computationally rather demanding,
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> employs a pre-screening step that can quickly exclude most compounds from
the graph-matching. In this step <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> determines a list of all dictionary fragments,
which are part of the sub-structure query. Molecules that don't contain all of the query's fragments
cannot contain the query itself. Therefore, these are skipped in the graph-matching phase.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="PathFp"></a>The <span class="keyword">PathFp</span> Descriptor</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">PathFp descriptor</span> encodes any linear strand of up to 7 atoms into a hashed binary
fingerprint of 512 bits. Therefore, every path of 7 or less atoms in the molecule is located. In a normalized way an
identifying text string is constructed from every path that encodes atomic numbers and bond orders.
From the text string a hash value is created, which is used to set the respective bit of the fingerprint.
The <span class="keyword">PathFp descriptor</span> is conceptually very similar to the 'folded fingerprints' that
software of Daylight Inc. uses for calculating chemical similarities.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="SphereFp"></a>The <span class="keyword">SphereFp</span> Descriptor</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">SphereFp descriptor</span> encodes circular spheres of atoms and bonds
into a hashed binary fingerprint of 512 bits. From every atom in the molecule, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
constructs fragments of increasing size by including n layers of atom neighbours (n=1 to 5).
These circular fragments are canonicalized considering aromaticity, but neglecting stereo configurations.
From the canonical representation a hash code is generated, which is used to set the respective bit of the fingerprint.
In the literature spherical fingerprints are sometimes referred to as HOSE codes and are in use for spectroscopy prediction.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="SkelSpheres"></a>The <span class="keyword">SkelSpheres</span> Descriptor</h3>
<p>When a more subtle structural similarity is needed, the <span class="keyword">SkeletonSpheres descriptor<span>
should be used. It is related to the <span class="keyword">SphereFp</span>, but also considers stereochemistry,
counts duplicate fragments, in addition encodes hetero-atom depleted skeletons, and has twice the resolution leading to less
hash collisions. It is the most accurate descriptor for calculating similarities of chemical graphs. On the flipside
it needs more memory and similarity calculations take slightly longer.
Technically, it is a byte vector with a resolution of 1024 bins.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="OrgFunctions"></a>The <span class="keyword">OrgFunctions</span> Descriptor</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">OrgFunctions descriptor</span> perceives molecules with the focus on available
funtional groups from a synthetic chemist's point of view. It also recognizes the steric or electronic features of
the neighborhood of the functional groups. It perceives molecules as being very similar, if they carry the same functional
groups in similar environments independent of the rest of the carbon skeletons.</p>
<p>The <span class="keyword">OrgFunctions descriptor</span> is neither a fingerprint nor an integer vector.
It rather stores all synthetically accessible functions of the molecule in a finely grained way.
DataWarrior distinguishes 1024 core functions, which typically overlap. Butenone for instance is recognized as
vinyl-alkyl-ketone as well as a carbonyl-activated terminal alkene. All 1024 functional groups are organized in a
tree structure that permits deriving similarities between related functions. These are taken into account, when
the similarity between two molecules, i.e. <span class="keyword">OrgFunctions descriptors</span>, is calculated.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Flexophore"></a>The <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> Descriptor</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptor</span> allows predicting 3D-pharmacophore similarities.
It provides an easy-to-use and yet powerful way to check, whether any two molecules may have a compatible
protein binding behavior. A high <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> similarity indicates that a significant
fraction of conformers of both molecules are similar concerning shape, size, flexibility and pharmacophore points.
Different from common 3D-pharmacophore approaches, this descriptor matches entire conformer sets rather than comparing
individual conformers, leading to higher predictability and taking molecular flexibility into account.</p>

<p>The calculation of the <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> descriptor is computationally quite demanding.
For a given molecule it starts with the creation of a representative set of up to 250 conformers using
a self organization based algorithm to construct small rigid molecule fragments, which are then connected with
likely torsion angles. This conformer generation approach balances high diversity and conformer likelyhood.
Then, the atoms of the underlying molecule are detected and classified, which have the potential to interact
with protein atoms in any way. De-facto an enhanced MM2 atom type is used to describe these atoms as interaction point.
In some cases multiple atoms contribute to one summarized interaction point, e.g. in aromatic rings.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Sample molecule with assigned interaction points</i></p>

<p>A molecule's <span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptor</span> now consists of a reduced, but complete
graph of the original molecule with the interaction points being considered graph nodes.
A graph edge between two nodes is encoded as a distance histogram between these nodes over all conformers.
Since the <span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptor</span> is a complete graph, every combination of any two nodes
is encoded and stored as part of the descriptor. Thus, the descriptor creation as well as the similarity calculation
from two descriptors depend heavily on the number of interaction points in each of them.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/similarity/completeGraph.jpeg" width="564" height="189"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Complete graph; distance histogram of highlighted edge</i></p>

<p>The calculation of the similarity between two <span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptors</span> involves a
graph matching algorithm that not only tries to match the largest possible subgraphs, but also tries to maximize
edge and node similarities. Edge similarities are derived from the distance histogram overlaps and node similarities
are taken from a interaction point (extended MM2 atom type) similarity matrix, which was originally derived from a
ligand-protein interaction analysis of the PDB database.</p>
