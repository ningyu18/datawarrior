<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>, as its name already implies, lives from data.
Since the amount of structured data being freely available over the internet is increasing daily,
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> has functionality built in to access some of the most
obvious data sources directly. Our intention is to make more data sources available with
future software updates.

</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Wikipedia"></a>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>
<span class="keyword">Wikipedia</span> is undoubtedly one of the most important freely available
sources of knowledge on the internet. Many thousand of its articles are about chemical substances.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> allows to retrieve an up-to-date list of all
<span class="keyword">Wikipedia</span> compound structures with their names and formulas into
a local <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file. For that choose <span class="menu">Retrieve Wikipedia Molecules</span>
from the <span class="menu">Database</span> menu. This offers an easy way to search
or otherwise process the chemical content of <span class="keyword">Wikipedia</span> offline.
Within the local file every compound has a link back into the corresponding
<span class="keyword">Wikipedia</span> web page. A right mouse click within
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> opens a popup menu that allows to open the compound's
<span class="keyword">Wikipedia</span> article in the web browser.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Chembl"></a>The ChEMBL Activity Database</h3>
<p>
The ChEMBL database is one of the most widely used compound activity databases available.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> permits to query the database by specifying search criteria
like biological targets, pubmed IDs, or chemical structures. Structure searches may be based on
chemical similarities, contained substructures, structure equivalence or tautomers.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/database/chemblQuery.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>ChEMBL Database Query Dialog</i></center></p>
<p>
In the following the ChEMBL database query dialog is explained in more detail:<br>
<b>Target Contains:</b> This field allows to quickly filter the target list by target name, gene accession number,
organism or other available target related information. One may specify multiple search phrases as
for instance "renin rat".<br>
<b>Hierarchical Protein Family Filter:</b> In the ChEMBL database many target proteins are assigned to
a small protein family. Multiple small related protein families are grouped on a higher level into a less
specific larger family. Related larger families are again grouped into an even larger one and so forth.
This forms a hierarchical tree of related proteins. This filter allows to filter targets by first
selecting a coarse protein family and then successively selecting subfamilies of the previously selected
protein family.<br>
<b>Select Target(s):</b> This text area contains a list of targets that are available in the ChEMBL
database and not filtered out by any filter criteria. If one or multiple targets of this list are
selected, then the search will only retrieve activity values on these targets.<br>
<b>Target Detail:</b> If one target is selected in the target list above, then this text area shows
some detail about the target, e.g. the name, UniProt accession number, type, organism and its protein
family classification.<br>
<b>Structure search options:</b> For running a structure search as part of the ChEMBL database search
one can either specify (draw, paste or drag&drop) a structure in the <b>Structure</b> field of the dialog
or you may select one or more structure in a DataWarrior window before opening the ChEMBL search dialog.
The type of structure search can be selected from a dedicated menu among sub-structure, exact match,
non-stereo specific match, tautomer match and structure similarity, which would activate a slider to
define the similarity limit. If some structures were pre-selected and the option <b>any selected structure</b>
is chosen, then a database compound is considered a hit, if its structure matches any of the
selected structures.<br>
<b>Pubmed-ID(s) or DOI(s):</b>Here one can specify one of multiple source papers separated by comma,
semicolon or space. For most papers the ChEMBL database contains Pubmed-IDs, while the DOI is often
missing. Thus, searching for Pubmed-IDs is much more likely to yield useful results than searching
for DOIs.<br>
<b>Group results with same compound, target, and result type:</b>If this option is selected then all results
from the same target and same chemical structure and merged into one result row. Within these rows
individual result values appear in separated lines within one table cell.<br>
For running a query one needs to specify at least one of the three kinds of search criteria, targets,
(a) compound structure(s), or paper references. If your intention is to download the entire database,
you should do that from the ChEMBL web site.

<h3><a name="COD"></a>The Crystallography Open Database (COD)</h3>
<p>
The COD is probably the most comprehensive open database for crystallographic structures of small
molecules. It is a valuable resource for studying conformational aspects of molecules like typical
torsion angles, bond lengths and atom distances. The COD contains more than 360.000 organic and
organo-metallic structures. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses conformational knowledge
extracted from the COD for its conformation generation algorithm.</p>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> allows to run sub-structure queries on the COD-database,
which returns the matching 3D-structures along with meta data. The picture below shows a
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window with organic structures from the COD and a form view
containing a large 3D-structure view.<p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/database/cod.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>COD database entry showing the torsion angle of an sulfonamide</i></center></p>
<p><b>If you have measured or will create X-ray structures from small molecules, please consider
uploading them to the COD. Open source software needs open data and the well known
<span class="keyword">Cambridge Structural Database</span> does not qualify as open data, since
neither its structures nor any extracted information may be used as part of open source software.</b></p>
<br>
<h3><a name="CustomURL"></a>Data From Custom URL</h3>
<p>The Internet is full of WebServices that offer the retrieval of data tables of any kind typically
in TAB delimited or other formats. For instance, the <span class="keyword">Open Source Malaria Project
</span> maintains data in a Google spreadsheet, which can be accessed in TAB delimited format via this
URL:<br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rvy6OiM291d1GN_cyT6eSw_C3lSuJ1jaR7AJa8hgGsc/export?format=tsv
<br>
One of its columns contains the chemical structures in SMILES format.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>'s <span class="menu">Database</span> menu contains an item
<span class="menu">Retrieve Data From URL</span> to retrieve data from such web resources. Whenever
a column of such a web resource contains SMILES codes, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> recognizes them and creates an additional column showing
the associated chemical structures. If one frequently retrieves updated data from the same URL,
then it may be a good idea to create a short macro with the URL retrieval task and save it in the
macro folder within the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installation folder. This way the
<span class="menu">Macro</span> menu contains an item to directly retrieve the data into a new
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window.
